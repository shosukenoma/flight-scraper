# Scraping stock prices using Go and Colly


## Overview
This Go project performs the following tasks:
- Takes in a list of company ticker symbols (e.g. AMZN for Amazon.com, Inc.)
- Sends HTTP requests to retrieve data from web pages that contain the companies' stock information
- Writes out the specified information to a .csv file



This project is inspired by [this blog article on ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-golang#how-to-web-scrape-in-go)
